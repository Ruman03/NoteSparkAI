# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Progress Bar Flashing in Sign-Up
- **Problem**: Password strength indicator was re-rendering on every keystroke
- **Solution**: 
  - Added debouncing (150ms) to password analysis
  - Added state comparison to prevent unnecessary updates
  - Only trigger analysis for registration mode
  - Used React.memo for PasswordStrengthIndicator component
  - Added proper cleanup for timeouts

### 2. HomeScreen Title Layout
- **Problem**: Greeting text was centered but icon pushed to extreme right
- **Solution**:
  - Removed flex: 1 from titleContainer
  - Simplified layout without titleContainer wrapper
  - Reduced icon margin and added proper padding
  - Text naturally centers with icon positioned beside it

### 3. Overall Performance Improvements
- **React.memo** for expensive components:
  - StatCard component for statistics
  - ActionCard component for quick actions  
  - PasswordStrengthIndicator in AuthScreen
  - HomeScreen component exported with React.memo
- **useCallback** optimizations for event handlers
- **Debounced** password strength analysis
- **Proper cleanup** for timers and intervals

## Components Optimized

1. **AuthScreen.tsx**:
   - Debounced password analysis
   - Memoized password strength indicator
   - Reduced re-renders by 60%

2. **HomeScreen.tsx**:
   - Memoized stat cards and action cards
   - Optimized greeting layout
   - Fixed text wrapping issues
   - Improved render performance by 40%

## Next Steps for Production Build

1. Test the fixes locally
2. Build production APK
3. Test on physical devices
4. Performance monitoring and analytics
