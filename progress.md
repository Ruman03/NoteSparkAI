## 📊 Detailed Development History

### **July 27, 2025: Production-Ready Application Achieved**

The app is now fully functional, stable, and prepared for the final phase of App Store preparation.

  * **Final Bug Fixes & Polish:**

      * **Notes Display Bug FIXED**: Resolved a critical UI rendering issue in the LibraryScreen. Notes fetched from Firestore now display correctly.
      * **Duplicate Note Bug FIXED**: Corrected a React state closure issue in the auto-save mechanism, preventing the creation of duplicate notes during an editing session.
      * **Live Production Testing**: Verified all core features on a physical device using a real document, confirming the end-to-end workflow is operational.

  * **Core Feature Completion:**

      * **Production Rich Text Editor**: Deployed a professional editing suite using `@10play/tentap-editor` with a full formatting toolbar and a robust 3-second auto-save feature.
      * **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Finalized a suite of **51 unit and integration tests**, ensuring the reliability of `AIService`, `NotesService`, and `NetworkService`.
      * **Dual OCR System Deployed**: Resolved a critical camera race condition. Implemented an intelligent system that uses ML Kit for speed and automatically falls back to the higher-accuracy Google Cloud Vision API for complex documents.

### **July 26, 2025: Historic Breakthrough - Firebase Crisis Resolved**

A series of complex, intertwined issues preventing user authentication were systematically diagnosed and resolved, transforming the app's foundation.

  * **The Crisis**: Firebase returned `[auth/unknown] An internal error has occurred. [ API key not valid. ]`, despite a valid key.

  * **Root Cause Analysis & Systematic Resolution:**

    1.  **Environment File Corruption**: Identified and fixed an invisible line break in the `.env` file that caused partial key loading.
    2.  **Deprecated Firebase API Usage**: Migrated the entire codebase from the legacy v8 namespaced API to the modern v9+ modular API, resolving underlying incompatibilities.
    3.  **Package Name Mismatch**: Corrected a critical mismatch between the Firebase project's package name (`com.notespark.ai`) and the Android app's package name (`com.notesparkai`). This involved updating `build.gradle`, renaming source directories, and updating manifest files.
    4.  **React Native Autolinking Cache Corruption**: Cleared all build caches (`android/build`, `android/app/build`) to force regeneration of autolinking files with the correct package name.

  * **Initial Build Success:**

      * Achieved the first successful Android build after resolving complex dependency and Gradle configuration issues. The initial working APK was launched on an emulator, validating the core setup.

This intensive debugging session not only fixed the authentication blocker but also resulted in a comprehensive architectural upgrade, establishing a stable, maintainable, and production-ready foundation.
