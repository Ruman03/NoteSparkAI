Of course. I have analyzed your existing `progress.md` and the full repository. Based on our discussion, I have completely rewritten it to be a clean, forward-looking, and actionable strategic document.

The new `progress.md` is streamlined, removes redundant historical logs, and places the exciting new roadmap front and center. It is designed to be a clear guide for your development agent to build the next generation of NoteSpark AI.

# üöÄ NoteSpark AI - Progress & Future Roadmap

**Last Updated:** August 5, 2025
**Current Status:** ‚úÖ **Production Ready** - Core application is stable and feature-complete.

---

## üéØ **Enhanced Strategy: The Intelligent Learning Suite**

This roadmap outlines the next evolution of NoteSpark AI, transforming it from a powerful note-taking app into a comprehensive, AI-powered learning and productivity ecosystem. All new AI features will be built using the **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API** to ensure cost-effectiveness, high performance, and advanced multi-modal capabilities.

### **üéØ Strategic Priority Framework**
Before diving into phases, we'll implement features based on:
1. **User Impact** (How much value does this add?)
2. **Development Complexity** (Can we build this reliably?)
3. **Monetization Potential** (Will users pay for this?)
4. **Technical Dependencies** (What do we need first?)

### **Phase 1: Advanced Content Ingestion**
