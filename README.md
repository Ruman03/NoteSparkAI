## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites**

* Node.js (v18 or newer)
* Yarn or npm
* React Native development environment set up for Android and iOS. See the [official guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
* An active Firebase project and an OpenAI API key.

### **Installation**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/NoteSparkAI.git](https://github.com/your-username/NoteSparkAI.git)
    cd NoteSparkAI
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install iOS Pods:**
    ```sh
    cd ios && pod install && cd ..
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
    * Add your Firebase configuration and Google Gemini API key:
        ```env
        GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

        FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
        FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
        FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
        FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
        FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
        FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
        ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    * **For Android:**
        ```sh
        npx react-native run-android
        ```
    * **For iOS:**
        ```sh
        npx react-native run-ios
        ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

* **Firebase:** Ensure your `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) are placed in the correct directories (`android/app/` and `ios/NoteSparkAI/` respectively).
* **React Native Reanimated:** The Babel plugin is required. Ensure `'react-native-reanimated/plugin'` is the **last** item in the `plugins` array in `babel.config.js`.
* **Worklets:** `react-native-reanimated` v4+ requires `react-native-worklets`. Ensure it is installed and the Babel plugin is configured.

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

The next phase of development will focus on transforming NoteSpark AI into a market-leading intelligent learning suite, leveraging the power and cost-effectiveness of the **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API**.

### **Phase 1: Advanced Content Ingestion**
* **Multi-Page Scanning:** Allow users to scan multiple pages in a single session.
* **Multi-Format Document Uploads:** Natively process `PDF`, `DOCX`, and `PPTX` files using Gemini 2.5 Flash's multi-modal capabilities.

### **Phase 2: Interactive Learning Suite (Pro Feature)**
* **AI-Powered Flashcards & Quizzes:** Automatically generate study aids from note content to enhance active recall and learning.

### **Phase 3: Dynamic Note Interaction (Pro Feature)**
* **Chat with Your Notes:** Implement a conversational AI (RAG model) that allows users to ask questions and get answers based *only* on the content of their notes.
