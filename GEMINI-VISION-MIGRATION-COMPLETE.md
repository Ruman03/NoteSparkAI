- **✅ ENHANCED**: `AIService.ts` - Integrated with Gemini multimodal capabilities  
- **✅ SIMPLIFIED**: Removed complex ML Kit and Cloud Vision fallback logic
- **✅ STREAMLINED**: Single API endpoint for all image/document processing

### 2. Dependency Cleanup
- **❌ REMOVED**: `@react-native-ml-kit/text-recognition` package (~5-10MB size reduction)
- **❌ ELIMINATED**: Google Cloud Vision API integration complexity
- **❌ REMOVED**: Complex OCR engine selection logic
- **✅ SIMPLIFIED**: Single Gemini API for all vision needs

### 3. User Interface Updates
- **✅ MODERNIZED**: Settings screen with "Enhanced Image Processing" toggle
- **❌ REMOVED**: Confusing OCR engine picker (ML Kit vs Cloud Vision)
- **✅ SIMPLIFIED**: Clear feature description for users
- **✅ ENHANCED**: Better subscription tier explanations

### 4. Settings & Context Updates
- **✅ UPDATED**: `SettingsContext` with `enhancedImageProcessing` preference
- **✅ MODERNIZED**: Subscription features (`advancedImageAnalysis` vs `cloudVisionOCR`)
- **✅ SIMPLIFIED**: Single toggle instead of complex engine selection
- **✅ IMPROVED**: Clear free vs pro tier distinctions

## 🚀 Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Capabilities
```typescript
// OLD: Complex fallback chain
try {
  if (cloudVisionConfigured) result = await cloudVision.process(image);
  if (!result) result = await mlKit.process(image);
} catch { /* handle multiple error types */ }

// NEW: Single Gemini call with superior results
const result = await geminiVision.extractTextFromImage(image, {
  preserveLayout: true,
  extractTables: true,
  enhanceHandwriting: true,
  detectLanguages: true,
  analyzeStructure: true
});
```

### Multi-Image Processing Revolution
```typescript
// OLD: Sequential processing with potential inconsistencies
for (const image of images) {
  const text = await processIndividually(image);
  combinedTexts.push(text);
}

// NEW: Intelligent multi-page document understanding
const result = await geminiVision.processMultipleImages(images, {
  combinePages: true,
  preservePageBreaks: true,
  maintainDocumentFlow: true
});
```
